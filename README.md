In every country, water plays a very crucial role in development. Almost in every sector water is needed to use in producing their products including agriculture, industry and many more. From the history of Tanzania, it has a lot of water throughout the country, but they face a lot of challenges concerning the reliability and access of the water in common households.   The dataset is all about water pumps, where we will be using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of water. We need to predict the outcome like if the water pump is functional or not, if functional, which oneâ€™s needs repair, and which of them are fully damaged that we cannot fix, then we need to arrange a new pump
