In every country, water plays a very crucial role in development. Almost in every sector water is needed to use in producing their products including agriculture, industry and many more. From the history of Tanzania, it has a lot of water throughout the country, but they face a lot of challenges concerning the reliability and access of the water in common households.   The dataset is all about water pumps, where we will be using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of water. We need to predict the outcome like if the water pump is functional or not, if functional, which oneâ€™s needs repair, and which of them are fully damaged that we cannot fix, then we need to arrange a new pump Thus in the data set, we have three outcomes which are functional, not functional and in some case functional but needs repair. Again, in the following data set if we notice we can see clearly that the data set is not perfectly balanced where more cases are functional followed by not functional and fewer cases related to functional but needs to repair. Through the finding and predictions, the Tanzanian Ministry of water would be able to improve the maintenance operation of water pumps in every location and which would help them serve their people clean and drinkable water
